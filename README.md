Acid Cam is a application that turns your webcam/video files into a work of Art.
Contains a lot of filters, and you can combine them with the custom filter option.
It also supports plugins (write your own filters in C++). This project was created
in hopes of providing some entertainment, or for the Glitch artist  to give you a 
starting image/video to use with other tools. There are also versions of this program
for other platforms specifically Linux/Windows. 

The video Acid Cam outputs is saved at a very high bitrate. Sometimes you will need to lower the bitrate to view the video with a video player. I usually import the video into Final Cut Pro X then lower the bitrate by exporting it as H.264. Another program you could use would be Handbrake. The following image is of MediaInfo on a 4K video created with Acid Cam. The overall bitrate is very high.
